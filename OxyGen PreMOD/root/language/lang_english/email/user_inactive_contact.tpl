Hallo {USERNAME},

Your Account on "{SITENAME}" is not active yet, to activate your account is simply enough click on this link:
{U_ACTIVE_REGISTRATION}

It is possible that your account is already active but with zero messages, in such case it ignores this e-mail.  
If you don't want to receive anymore this e-mail you write at least a message on the board.
